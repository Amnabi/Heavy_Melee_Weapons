Bug Report:
Search and Destroy
	- Search and Destroy is counting the Burst Blade and Plasmalance as ranged
weapons while they have ammo.
	- Setting a pawn on search/destroy(r) makes them attempt to aim the plasmalance,
causing the pawn to stand at max range, doing nothing since Plasmalance has no XML for aiming.
	- Seems like an issue with Search and Destroy.
