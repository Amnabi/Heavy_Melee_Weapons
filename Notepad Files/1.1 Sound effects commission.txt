Task Description:  Custom Sound effects
I need 5 custom sound effects for a planned update to Heavy Melee Weapons
1)a onhit sound for the Burst Blade - should sound similar to the zeus hammer, except give impression
of hacking into something instead of smashing it.
2)a onhit sound for a rocket hammer
3)a onhit sound for a gravity hammer-esque weapon
4)a onhit sound for the Relic Maul's Psychic Smash attack. Should be remeniscent of the psychic shock
lance's own sound effect.
5)a onhit sound for a cleave attack.
Budget:$50, price negotiable.
Deadline:April 1st, not a joke.
