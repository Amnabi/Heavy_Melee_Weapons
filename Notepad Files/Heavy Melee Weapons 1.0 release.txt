_**Heavy Melee Weapons**_

Have you ever want a pawn to dismantle a Centipede with an oversized sword?
No? Well too bad.

- Heavy Melee Weapons adds 4 massive melee weapons that require either a 
tough pawn or power armor to equip, giving the equipped pawn acces to great damage and the weapons unique features.

- Burst Blade: An ultra tech greatsword with monosword edge.
At the cost of components, the burst blade can release an EMP around the pawn equipped with it.

- Plasma Lance: A plasma-tipped lance with a built-in incendiary cannon.
At the cost of chemfuel, the plasma lance detonates an incendiary charge, igniting everything in a cone in front of the pawn equipped with it.

- Relic Maul: An imitation of a legendary hammer. The maul provides the same benefits of an Eltex Staff while being an amazing melee weapon.
The Relic maul has the ability to psychic shock the next pawn hit with weapon at the cost of the equipped pawn's psyfocus.

- Heavy Monosword: A bigger variant of the Royalty DLC mono sword. No unique purpose (yet)other than looking cool.

All these weapons have bladelink variants and can be bought from the Empire Faction.
